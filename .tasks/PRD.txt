# Overview  
LocalChat is an intranet-only messaging application designed for organizations that require secure, private communication within their local network infrastructure. The application enables real-time messaging, file sharing, and group collaboration without any dependency on external internet connectivity, ensuring complete data privacy and security within the organization's network perimeter.

The solution addresses the need for secure internal communication in environments where internet access is restricted, sensitive data must remain within the local network, or organizations want complete control over their communication infrastructure. Target users include corporate teams, research facilities, government agencies, and any organization requiring air-gapped communication systems.
