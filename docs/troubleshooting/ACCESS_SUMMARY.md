## 🔧 Why Domain Names Need Configuration

Domain names like `lgu-chat.lguquezon.internal` are not real internet domains. They only work if:
1. The device has a hosts file entry, OR
2. Your network has a local DNS server configured

The IP address `192.168.32.14` always works because it's a direct network address.
